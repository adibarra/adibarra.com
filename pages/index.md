Hi, I'm <span class="fw-900">Alec</span>.<br>
I'm a student studying <span class="fw-900">Computer Science</span>.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've loved learning all about computers and programming.<br>

I am currently learning a lot about <span class="fw-900">Web Development</span>, specifically <span class="fw-900">Vite+Vue.js</span>.<br>
However, I also enjoy learning about <span class="fw-900">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="fw-900">Artificial Intelligence</span>.<br>

My hope is to one day be able to work in the field of <span class="fw-900">Robotics</span> since it merges both of my passions -- programming and engineering.
