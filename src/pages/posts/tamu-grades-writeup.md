## Wait, Again?

Yup, that's right, I re-wrote the original TAMU Grade Distribution website that I made in 2022 and posted about [here](/posts/tamugd-writeup). My goal with the original site was to learn about web development, and as a result, the code isn't great, and its UI/UX isn't much better.

Since then, the site has been getting a lot of traffic. So, I've decided to re-design it from the ground up using the knowledge I've gained over the past year or two.

## Goals

The main goals for this re-write are:

> 1. **Improve UI/UX**: I want to make the new version much more visually appealing, ergonomic, and easier to use.
> 2. **Improve Performance**: I want to improve performance by using modern web technologies.
> 3. **Improve Code Quality**: I want to use a framework and build tools to make the codebase more maintainable.
> 4. **Add New Features**: I want to add new features like a natural language search bar.
> 5. **Make it Mobile Friendly**: I want the new version to work well on all devices.

## Tech Stack

The original version was built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It lacked frameworks, build tools, or any modern workflow due to my inexperience at the time. The project was just a bunch of manually edited and minified files.

This approach led to a messy and unmaintainable codebase. So, I decided to use a proper tech stack for the new version.

### Frontend

One of the biggest changes was adopting a frontend framework. I chose <GithubLink repo="vuejs/vue" />, which I've been using for a while and really enjoy. I also decided to use <GithubLink repo="vitejs/vite" /> as the build tool since it's super fast and easy to use. Additionally, I decided to use <GithubLink repo="unocss/unocss" /> for its fantastic superset of atomic CSS classes. I also utilized TypeScript throughout the application to catch errors early and improve code quality.

This modern setup makes the frontend **much** more maintainable and easier to work with. Using components and build tools has helped me clean up the codebase, making it more readable and extensible for future improvements.

Another decision I made was to not use a UI framework. Instead I wanted to build the UI from scratch to learn more about CSS and design. Because of this, the new version has a more consistent look and feel compared to the original.

### Backend

This time around I decided to use <GithubLink repo="fastify/fastify" /> as the backend framework. I also switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL, which is more powerful and widely used in production environments.

The backend is responsible for fetching data from the database and serving it to the frontend in both versions. However, the new backend also handles the scraping and parsing of the grade distribution data, which was previously done manually with a different script.

### Automation and Deployment

One of the most significant improvements I made was automating the build and deployment processes. Now, whenever I push changes to the repo, GitHub Actions are triggered. These actions build two Docker images: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

My deployment server automatically pulls these images and deploys the updated application. This setup allows me to easily deploy changes automatically without needing to worry about the build process.

Using Docker also helps with the portability of the application. It helps in ensuring consistency between development and production environments.

## Architecture

The old version of the site was divided into a static frontend and a backend, which served the frontend and handled database queries. The new version, however, keeps the two entirely separate. This is because the app is now built into two separate images. The frontend image includes an Nginx server that serves the static files generated by Vite, while the backend image includes the Fastify server that only serves the API and runs background tasks.

The project now uses a monorepo architecture with over 10 packages. This allows me to share code between the frontend and backend, such as types and constants while keeping them separate. It also makes it easier to manage dependencies and run scripts across the application.
