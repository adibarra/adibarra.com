Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm <span font-600 text--c-accent>Alec</span>.<br>

I'm currently a <span font-600 text--c-accent>Computer Science</span> student.<br>
I've also previously studied <span font-600 text--c-accent>Electrical Engineering</span> for a few years.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated with computers, hardware, and programming.<br>

Currently, I'm learning a lot about <span font-600 text--c-accent>Web Development</span>, but I also love learning about <span font-600 text--c-accent>Machine Learning</span>.
My hope is to one day work in the field of <span font-600 text--c-accent>Robotics</span> since it merges both of my passions -- hardware and software.
