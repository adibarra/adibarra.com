Hello there 👋, I'm <span class="font-600 text--c-accent">Alec</span>.<br>

I'm a recent <span class="font-600 text--c-accent">Computer Science</span> graduate.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated with computers, hardware, and programming.<br>

I'm a <span class="font-600 text--c-accent">Full‑Stack Developer</span> who enjoys building scalable, production‑ready applications.

I've developed projects like <a href="/projects#tamu-grades" class="font-600! text--c-accent!">TAMU Grades</a>, a web app serving tens of thousands of users by turning raw unstructured university data into an accessible platform, and <a href="/projects#shadle" class="font-600! text--c-accent!">Shadle</a>, a Wordle-style web game for guessing colors with server-side validation and statistics tracking.

I've also built <a href="/projects#data-doctor" class="font-600! text--c-accent!">Data Doctor</a>, a full-stack web app for ML training dataset quality control with interactive editing and ML-powered duplicate detection, and <a href="/projects#hcr-using-cnns" class="font-600! text--c-accent!">HCR using CNNs</a>, an implementation of convolutional neural networks achieving 99.6% accuracy on handwritten character recognition.
