Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm <span fw-900>Alec</span>.<br>

I'm a currently a <span fw-900>Computer Science</span> student.<br>
I've also previously studied <span fw-900>Electrical Engineering</span> for a few years.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've loved learning as much as I can about computers, programming, and circuitry.<br>

I currently have a bunch of projects that I'm working on.<br>
My main one is about <span fw-900>Web Development</span>, specifically <span fw-900>Vite</span> with <span fw-900>Vue.js</span>.<br>
However, I also enjoy learning all about <span fw-900>Machine Learning</span> and <span fw-900>Artificial Intelligence</span>.<br>

My hope is to one day be able to work in the field of <span fw-900>Robotics</span> since it merges both of my passions -- programming and engineering.
