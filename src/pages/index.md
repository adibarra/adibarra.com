Hello there 👋, I'm <span font-600 text--c-accent>Alec</span>.<br>

I'm a recent <span font-600 text--c-accent>Computer Science</span> graduate.<br>
I've also previously studied <span font-600 text--c-accent>Electrical Engineering</span> for a few years.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated with computers, hardware, and programming.<br>

I'm a <span font-600 text--c-accent>Full‑Stack Developer</span> who enjoys building scalable, production‑ready applications.

I've developed projects like <span font-600 text--c-accent>TAMU Grades</span>, a web app serving thousands of users by turning raw unstructured university data into an accessible platform, led a team building <span font-600 text--c-accent>Fintasy</span>, a real-time paper trading platform with social features, and developed multiple <span font-600 text--c-accent>Machine Learning</span> models, including some for handwritten character recognition that achieved over 99% accuracy.
