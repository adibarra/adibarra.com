Hello there 👋, I'm <span font-600 text--c-accent>Alec</span>.<br>

I'm a recent <span font-600 text--c-accent>Computer Science</span> graduate.<br>
Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated with computers, hardware, and programming.<br>

I'm a <span font-600 text--c-accent>Full‑Stack Developer</span> who enjoys building scalable, production‑ready applications.

I've developed projects like <span font-600 text--c-accent>TAMU Grades</span>, a web app serving tens of thousands of users by turning raw unstructured university data into an accessible platform, and <span font-600 text--c-accent>Shadle</span>, a Wordle-style web game for guessing colors with server-side validation and statistics tracking.

I've also built <span font-600 text--c-accent>Data Doctor</span>, a full-stack web app for ML training dataset quality control with interactive editing and ML-powered duplicate detection, and <span font-600 text--c-accent>HCR using CNNs</span>, an implementation of convolutional neural networks achieving 99.6% accuracy on handwritten character recognition.
